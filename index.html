            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Even though my main passion is becoming a skilled data analyst, I see the importance of delving into web application development. 
                This extra skill set can be a game-changer in my data analytics journey by allowing me to create engaging and user-friendly data visualizations and dashboards. 
                To give you some context, I've already dipped my toes into this area by taking a basic course in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on Udemy back when I was studying engineering. 
                It's like the building blocks for my adventure into the world of web development.</p>
